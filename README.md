										   Welcome to Loop :-)

Loop is a mobile application that can answer many of today's issues regarding productivity and efficiency. Specifically, Loop is capable of solving the following problems:

Problem 1

● There is no application in the market that utilizes GPS to map out and help schedule the course of your entire day

Solution 1

Loop ­- the application's primary feature

Users are able to create a "Loop" which consists of several smart pins that represents each of the user's tasks over a given day. The user sees a Loop as a bird's eye view of sequentially mapped out, location­specific “smart pins” that reflect where and when the user has scheduled tasks for that day. Each added task will be set by location, start and end time from the user’s scheduler then strung together on a map reflecting each task scheduled. Assuming enough time is allotted, Loop will utilize Google Maps and Google traffic to determine the amount time that it will take to travel between these points as well as determine how much free (or unscheduled) time the user has between future tasks. The user's Loop will work much like an alarm clock, giving the user the opportunity to set reminders before tasks, and have loops repeat on days with the same schedules.

Further applications:

● Loop will understand the user's tendencies and provide useful suggestions that may improve their daily routine

● Advertising and marketing space known as “digital billboards” will reach users traveling to and between tasks. These location and time­specific alerts will be intelligently designed to reach the user in the most convenient method possible

● Task completion can be recorded and used to determine a "loop score" which allows the user to track and share their efficiency, work ethic, and growth. This will be detailed later

Problem 2

Scheduling events is a hassle.The mutual time taken to schedule an event ­ regardless of party size ­ is wasted in determining who is free at the convenience of each other’s schedule.

Solution 2

Hyperlinking ­- the application’s most marketable feature

We define "Hyperlinking" as the syncing of unscheduled future time from two or more users' Loops, which determines the most convenient time and location for users to connect. If users are scheduling a lunch or shopping trip, Loop will compare each user's interests and tendencies to determine the fastest and most preferable method to meet.

Further Applications:

● Again, businesses can promote themselves to hyperlinked loops, especially if they intend on catering to larger groups (i.e. clubs, restaurants, etc)

● Users will be able to specify how much of their Loop will be able to Hyperlink. For example, a user can designate Loop to hyperlink just their work hours with coworkers' Loops

Problem 3

Users lack a metric to calculate their work­ethic.

Solution 3

Loop Score ­- The application’s competition driving feature.

Loop Score makes use of Loops to determine statistics regarding efficiency, work­ethic, and timeliness. The Loop Score utilizes algorithms to quantify the user's various productivity traits. The user’s Loop Score is especially affected by Hyperlinking. When users Hyperlink, they can request that their task be validated by other users who also partook in the task. Once validated, that task will have a higher impact on the Loop Score of that user. The user's Loop Score can be shared via social networking and is particularly useful at showcasing traits that aren't seen on a Resume or LinkedIn profile.

Further Applications:

● A high Loop Score can show future employers that the user is a good combination of dependable and hardworking

● Sharing of the user’s Loop Score can ignite a competitive spirit between users, which commonly causes applications to “go viral”

Problem 4

Managers do not have an effective means of ensuring productivity of employees at all times.

Solution 4

Validate Plus (WIP) ­- Gives users the ability to assign tasks in which the phone of the user who received the task enters Validate Mode. Validate Mode turns on at the beginning of the task, preventing the user from accessing other applications. Upon completion of the task, the user’s phone will end Validate Mode and resume normal functionality. This feature is extremely valuable to managers who want to keep their employees productive and distraction­free. Furthermore, this feature will give managers the ability to rank their employees based on how well they complete their tasks, creating a leaderboard that will give employees an incentive to work harder.

Further Applications:

● Validate Plus will be offered as an in­app purchase, tailored for users in a manager or coordinator role

● Validate Plus can be utilized for virtually any type of task where productivity is essential, such as completing documents or participating in team meetings

● This feature can be very useful for managers who need to closely monitor the tasks of their employees and actively make sure the tasks are being completed in an efficient and timely manner

● Leaders among the leaderboard can share said data for HR and employment ­- attributing to the user’s Loop Score

Conclusion

Loop gives users the ability to massively enhance their overall productivity, benefiting both employees and employers alike. Giving users the ability to both visually organize their day and use their schedule to effectively make plans with others, Loop is the smart­scheduler of the future.
